# Logged-In User: 

As a fully eligible logged-in user, the user will be taken to their My Dashboard, where they will have a variety of functions to choose from, including but not limited to Job Search, My Resumes, Favorites, and Edit my Profile. The basic search will return all recommended jobs for the user in a list format. Each listing will have the job name, company, description, and some metadata, such as the likelihood of landing the job, job rating, interview success rate, etc. The search can also be filtered by various fields to narrow the results list or to find a job with specific constraints, using filters such as Job Title, Company, Location, etc. Clicking on a job listing will expand the listing to give them complete information about the job, including all data that we generate (TBD). The user will also be able to save specific jobs to their profile using a Favorite button so that they easily navigate to jobs they are interested in by visiting the Favorites section of their dashboard.
