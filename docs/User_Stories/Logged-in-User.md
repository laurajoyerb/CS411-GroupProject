# User with a Sparse LinkedIn account: 

If the user is missing information on their LinkedIn account, they will be notified immediately after logging in that the app will not be able to provide recommendations until they provide LinkedIn with more information. This information includes, but is not limited to, the industry in which they are interested in, what types of jobs they are looking for, their skills, etc. They will receive recommendations on what to fill in on their LinkedIn profile so that they have a starting point when they go back to LinkedIn to complete their profile. They will have a Go to LinkedIn button, which will take them to LinkedIn, and a Take me to My Dashboard button, which will take them to a limited dashboard where the main Job Search function will be greyed out but other tools, such as the Resume Parser , will be available for use.
