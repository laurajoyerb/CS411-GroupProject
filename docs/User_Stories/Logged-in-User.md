# Logged-In User

As a logged-in user, the user will be presented with the Dashboard, where they will have a variety of functions to choose from, including the *Job Recommender*, *Resume Grader*, *Job Search* and *Edit my Profile* modal.

The automatic Job Recommender will return all recommended jobs for the user in a list format. Each listing will have the position and company metadata, and clicking on a listing will reveal more information about the job, such as company culture information and interview information. Users can conveniently edit their industry, which the Job Recommender utilizes to find jobs, using the Edit Profile button on the dashboard or the Edit Industry button on the Job Recommender page itself.

The Resume Grader will return detailed resume analysis information and a resume grade to the user after the user uploads their resume.

The Job Search will allow a user discover company culture information and interview information for positions and companies of their choosing.
