# Logged-In User Search:

As a logged-in user, the user will be able to connect their LinkedIn and view jobs suited to their interests and experiences. The basic search will return all recommended jobs for the user in a list format. Each listing will have the job name, company, description, and some metadata, such as likelihood of landing the job, job rating, interview success rate, etc. The search can also be filtered by various fields to narrow the results list or to find a job with specific constraints, using filters such as Job Title, Company, Location, etc. Clicking on a job listing will expand the listing to give them complete information about the job, including all metadata that we generate(TBD). The user will also be able to save specific jobs to their profile using a Favorite button, so that they easily navigate to jobs they are interested in by visited the Favorites section of their profile.
