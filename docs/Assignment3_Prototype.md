<h1> Assignment #3: Our Prototype </h1>

<p>
For todayâ€™s prototype, we are demonstrating a piece of our application that fetches information from Indeed.com about a particular position at a particular company. Although Indeed.com provides us with a simple API to request basic information about a company itself, it does not provide an API to get the robust data that is required for our project. This information includes the rating of the job, pros and cons of the job, and individual reviews of the job. To get all of these data points, we wrote our own API for Indeed.com. It runs on Flask, and it uses a web scraper to get all of the information we need. We chose to use Flask because it can run an easy to use web scraper framework, called Selenium, to pull data from webpages. For our front end, we chose to use Angular, which is an extensive framework that takes advantage of the model-view-controller hierarchy to provide a lean and fast single page app experience for the end user. To run our Indeed API service and our Angular frontend, we use NGINX on our AWS EC2 instance to handle requests to our separate services. At the completion of our project lifecycle, we hope to have our entire application running as separate components, like we have done so far, so that we can take full advantage of the microservices ecosystem.
