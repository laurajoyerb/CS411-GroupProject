## LinkedIn Jobs Recommender via LinkedIn and Glassdoor Reviews:

Allow user to connect their LinkedIn account to our app, which will find jobs or internships in their field that are filtered using their current experience and skills. Then, using that job data, our app will connect to Glassdoor, where the app will retrieve the ratings of each particular job at a company as well as user reviews of that job, the numerical data of the number of people who interviewed and got the job, the experiences of those people and the people who already have the position, and potentially any tips for the interviews for those jobs. Then, we will send the textual data to IBM Watson to do sentiment analysis and return the average experience of an individual in that position, and the average experience of an individual interviewing for that position. We will use the numerical data to calculate how likely the candidate is to get that job if they receive an interview, and return a summary of all of our results for each job back to the user.

## Restaurant Recommender:
Users log into app through their facebook account. Users choose type of cuisine they want to eat, price range, and distance. Restaurants are generated based on this data, yelp reviews for restaurants are shown, and a map for how the user gets to their preferred restaurant. A Spotify playlist is also generated that correlates with the mood of the type of food the user chooses.
