## LinkedIn Jobs Recommender/ Glassdoor Reviews:

	Pull data from LinkedIn and recommend jobs/internships based on user profile and experience. Then, pull data from Glassdoor and inform the user about how likely they are to get that particular job based on user feedback about that particular position, and also based off the reviews of that particular company

## Restaurant Recommender:
Track your meals for ~1 week to get a sense of a user’s tastes. Recommend restaurant based on these tastes, how far away they want to travel, yelp reviews and then generate a spotify playlist that correlates with the mood of the type of food the user chooses to get.

## Fastest Path From Pt A → Pt B:
	
Combines public transportation, bike, walking, uber, etc to find the fastest possible route from point a to point b. Would get data from Uber Api and MBTA API and combine the information to create the fastest way to get somewhere. Users would be presented with the estimated cost to time ratio and would be able to pick their preferred route.
